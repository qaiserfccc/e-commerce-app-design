# Mobile and integration API

The site publishes its machine-readable contract at **`https://<site-origin>/api/openapi.json`** and a compact endpoint directory at **`https://<site-origin>/api`**. The OpenAPI document is also checked in at [`../openapi.json`](../openapi.json). The current contract is **1.0.0**. Existing `/api/...` paths remain the v1 paths for compatibility; no `/api/v1/...` URL aliases exist yet. Breaking changes should be introduced under a new URL prefix rather than silently changing the existing contract.

The API is usable from Flutter Android, iOS, Windows, other native clients, and server integrations. Native apps do not use browser CORS. POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests without `Origin` are accepted for native/server clients; browser cross-origin writes remain rejected. Do not send an `Origin` header that claims to be the website unless the request is actually from that origin. **Flutter Web** is not enabled for cross-origin credentialed calls; host it same-origin or add a separately reviewed, explicit CORS allowlist before enabling it.

## Cross-platform architecture status

Next.js remains the full-stack web application and trusted owner of business rules, database access, and REST endpoints. The Flutter Android/iOS client in [`../apps/mobile`](../apps/mobile) consumes this shared API for shopper and commerce-admin workflows. Admin sessions are separate from shopper sessions and stored in platform secure storage; server authorization remains authoritative. TanStack DB and a server-sealed Neon Realtime catalog-version query are implemented for the web catalog; the Realtime service must be provisioned and its server variables configured before live subscriptions can connect. The chatbot uses Mastra with Vercel AI Gateway when the server-side `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is configured, and otherwise retains its deterministic FAQ/catalog response. Every answer is grounded against current public database facts; ISK does not store conversation history. Third-party AI processing and retention policies may apply. The architecture and external prerequisites are tracked in [`architect/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`](architect/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md).

Do not treat adding TanStack Start beside Next.js as a mobile API strategy. TanStack Start is a separate full-stack framework option; the current API contract remains the common boundary. Realtime must not expose database access or bypass the signed-cookie auth model. The web catalog falls back to its API-backed SWR behavior if the Realtime endpoint is unavailable; native clients use the documented REST endpoints and refresh responses as needed. The current Mastra chatbot is server-side, stateless, and read-only; future background agents must use the same permission-checked application operations for business writes.

The Realtime endpoint `GET /api/realtime/catalog` returns a short-lived sealed public aggregate query and Realtime URL. The capability is a bearer credential: do not log it or store it persistently. Only configure approved origins in [`../neon.ts`](../neon.ts); do not expose `NEON_REALTIME_SECRET`.

Product-page search metadata, JSON-LD, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` are web crawler surfaces and do not change the Flutter-facing REST contract. Product SEO title/description and first-party media remain available through the existing product API; no endpoint or response schema changed for the SEO import.

These REST handlers call the same permission-checked server operations used by the web admin, so server-side role, inventory, validation, and business-transition rules remain authoritative. JSON admin writes reject cross-origin browser requests; native clients may omit `Origin`. Do not call internal Server Action URLs from a mobile app. Upload endpoints remain multipart and use the explicit file/type/size validation described above. All newly added endpoints and payload details are also published in the OpenAPI contract; where an operation uses the reusable `AdminJsonObject` schema, the named server operation provides the authoritative field validation.

Order details are authorized by the shopper session for orders belonging to that account, or by the matching signed `isk-lenses-order-receipt` cookie. Send `receipt` as the order ID to read the most recently issued receipt. Native clients must store this cookie securely and send it alongside the shopper cookie; the Flutter app does so. New receipts last 90 days and are replaced by the next checkout on the same device; previously issued receipts keep their original expiry. Existing guest orders and statuses are unchanged, but old guest orders cannot be recovered from an order number alone. Guests without a valid receipt should contact the store. A status is the latest store-entered order status; there is no separate per-item tracking, courier integration, history, or independent shipment status. Never interpret `paid` or `refunded` as proof of transit or delivery. Expiry or sign-out does not delete orders.

`GET /api/storefront/session` also returns `savedShippingAddress`, the shipping address from the most recent order explicitly associated with the authenticated account, or `null` for guests and accounts without orders. Use it only to prefill editable, untouched fields; clear account-derived values on sign-out. It is not a separately managed address book and guest orders are never used for account autofill. Checkout accepts optional guest email, last name, address line 2, and province; a supplied email must be valid. A guest without email receives a separate customer record with a null email, not a fabricated address or a shared anonymous identity. Apply migration `0025_optional_customer_email.sql` before deploying this checkout; existing records are not modified.

Product reviews are genuine customer submissions or store-entered feedback, not fabricated content. The review GET response includes `settings.enabled`, `settings.allowSubmission`, and `settings.autoApprove` alongside approved reviews; show the review section and submission form according to those flags. Submissions follow the existing moderation setting.

The blog resources endpoint lists external publishers, not hosted articles. Web and Flutter link to the Bella Lense archive on its own site; the archive and its articles are maintained independently. No third-party article text or images are copied. The separate `/api/blogs` endpoint provides original code-managed ISK articles; `image` is a same-origin path to an original illustration, and `imageAlt` describes it. These illustrations are not product photos. Adding or editing articles currently requires a code change and deployment. No blog database tables or admin editor exist.

The home API is the canonical cross-platform design contract. Read `data.content.appearance` for the shared `palette`, `button`, `textbox`, `menu`, and `navigation` values. Read `data.content.configuration` for the visible/order-ranked sections plus `heroLayout` and `heroAutoplayMs`. The banner collection at `data.content.banners` is the same active hero set consumed by the website and mobile storefront. Native clients should treat these values as display settings, preserve API order, and ignore unknown enum values by falling back to the documented sky defaults. Admin clients save these through `PUT /api/admin/content/settings/appearance` or `/api/admin/content/settings/home_configuration`; the server validates every write and database migration `0021_home_and_appearance_settings.sql` must be applied before saving the new settings.

The admin API covers the completed commerce workflows. The web-only Project Kanban is project coordination UI rather than store operations and is not included in the customer/mobile commerce API.

## Flutter / FlutterFlow / Windows setup

The Flutter Android/iOS storefront and commerce-admin client is in `apps/mobile`. See its README for local setup, API-origin configuration, build commands, admin module coverage, and the current release-readiness boundary.

1. Use the deployed site origin as the base URL; all API paths above are relative to that origin. `https://isklenses.com` currently serves the verified Vercel storefront and API. `isklenses.online` still resolves to Hostinger and is not a valid production API origin.
2. Open `/api/openapi.json` in an OpenAPI client generator or use it as the reference when configuring FlutterFlow API Calls. Set `Accept: application/json` and `Content-Type: application/json` on JSON writes.
3. Use a cookie jar/session-preserving HTTP client for shopper login. Login/register sets the HttpOnly `isk-lenses-customer-session` cookie; send it on later order-history and checkout requests. Retain the cookie securely, honor its expiry, and clear it on logout. The API does **not** issue bearer tokens. On FlutterFlow, if its API-call client does not retain `Set-Cookie`, implement the login/checkout sequence in a custom action with a cookie-aware client rather than copying the password into app state.
4. Admin cookies use `isk-lenses-admin-session`; keep admin credentials and session access out of logs, URLs, analytics, and client source. Staff/admin/owner permissions are still enforced server-side.
5. In Flutter Web, same-origin hosting is the supported browser option. For a separate web origin, a reviewed explicit CORS policy is required; the FastAPI starter has a separate `API_CORS_ORIGINS` setting but does not configure CORS for the Next.js API.

Native Flutter sketch using Dio (`dio`, `cookie_jar`, and `dio_cookie_manager`):

```dart
final cookieJar = CookieJar();
final api = Dio(BaseOptions(
  baseUrl: 'https://shop.example.com',
  headers: {'Accept': 'application/json'},
));
api.interceptors.add(CookieManager(cookieJar));

final page = await api.get(
  '/api/products',
  queryParameters: {'page': 1, 'limit': 24, 'q': 'blue'},
);
final session = await api.post('/api/storefront/session', data: {
  'action': 'login',
  'email': email,
  'password': password,
});
// Dio's cookie manager stores Set-Cookie and sends the session cookie later.
```

For guest or signed-in checkout, first load `/api/delivery-rules`. Compute the matching fee for the current subtotal for display, then send the quote with the selected products. The server independently checks current product prices, stock, and delivery pricing; never treat client totals as authoritative.

```json
{
  "checkoutKey": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
  "email": "shopper@example.com",
  "shippingAddress": {
    "firstName": "Ayesha",
    "lastName": "Khan",
    "phone": "+923001234567",
    "addressLine1": "House and street",
    "addressLine2": "",
    "city": "Karachi",
    "province": "Sindh",
    "postalCode": "74000"
  },
  "items": [{
    "productId": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002",
    "variantId": null,
    "quantity": 1,
    "quotedUnitPrice": "2199.00",
    "quotedCurrency": "PKR"
  }],
  "quotedDeliveryFee": "200.00"
}
```

Use the same `checkoutKey` only when retrying the same checkout attempt; generate a new UUID for a new attempt. `email` is optional for guests and should be omitted for an authenticated shopper. Payment is cash on delivery only; there is no online payment API. The cart is client-side state. Shopper order history returns summaries; authorized order detail is available separately.

The UUIDs in the JSON are illustrative: replace `productId` with an actual UUID returned by the catalog, and generate a fresh `checkoutKey` per checkout attempt.

## API behavior and operational notes

- JSON success responses generally use `{ "data": ... }`; errors use `{ "error": "..." }`. Checkout returns `orderNumber` and `reused`. The paginated product response includes `{ data, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages }, timestamp }`.
- `GET /api/products` retains the legacy unbounded response when called without `page`; mobile clients should always pass `page` and may pass `limit` (1–100, default 24). Filters are `category`, `brand`, `shadeId`, `lensTypeId`, and `q`; supported sort orders are `newest`, `price_asc`, `price_desc`, `name_asc`, and `featured`.
- Public catalog and settings responses use `no-store` HTTP headers so clients and CDNs do not bypass server-side invalidation. The server caches shared catalog and content reads. Media responses may be stored but require revalidation on every reuse; clients should send the returned ETag in `If-None-Match` to avoid retransmitting unchanged images. Account, order, and admin responses are `no-store`. Honor HTTP cache headers and do not persist stale inventory or prices.
- `GET /api/storefront/home` returns `data.chrome.whatsappSupportUrl`, the shared WhatsApp support link for the web and mobile apps. It opens a prefilled message; the shopper must send it in WhatsApp. This support number is currently application-configured and separate from admin-editable general contact details.
- `GET /api/mobile/android` exposes the same website-hosted Android APK used by `/mobile-app`: `{data:{status:"available",downloadUrl,publishedAt:null}}`. The APK is served as `/isklenses.apk` from the production site. The app landing page is web-only; mobile clients can discover the same download using this endpoint. APK replacement and signing requirements are described in `apps/mobile/README.md`.
- The web storefront displays a floating WhatsApp link and a contact-page button using that shared URL. Flutter exposes it in the main navigation and contact page; pushed screens do not have a floating button. `POST /api/chatbot` returns `{ label: "Connect on WhatsApp", href: "https://wa.me/..." }` in `data.links` when a message mentions WhatsApp, including when medical or order-status safeguards apply. Clients should render that link as an external action, validate its HTTPS `wa.me` host, and never send the message automatically.
- Expect `400` validation errors, `401` unauthenticated/invalid credentials, `403` forbidden/origin rejection, `404` missing resources, `409` checkout conflicts, `413` oversized bodies, `415` unsupported content types, `429` rate limits, and `5xx` service failures. Retry transient failures with bounded backoff; for checkout always reuse its idempotency key.
- Current public throttling is best-effort per process, not distributed. Configure edge-level rate limits before broad production traffic.
- The Meta webhook is server-to-server only and verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256`; it is not a mobile client endpoint.
- The store assistant is grounded in the current public FAQ/catalog data. `POST /api/chatbot` accepts `{ "message": "..." }` (1–200 characters) and is rate limited to 20 requests per IP per 10 minutes. With `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, the server runs the response through the `vercel/google/gemini-2.5-flash` Mastra agent; without it, the deterministic response remains available. The agent has no tools, account/order access, persistent memory, or write permissions; it cannot provide lens fitting or eye-health advice. `GET /api/chatbot/knowledge` preserves lens specification fields in product matches. Admin changes use `PUT /api/chatbot/settings` with the admin cookie. Migration `0019_chatbot_settings.sql` is applied to the configured database; apply it to other target databases before saving chatbot settings there.

## FastAPI quick-service starter

The independent scaffold at [`services/fastapi/README.md`](../services/fastapi/README.md) provides a health endpoint, a `/api/v1` namespace, generated Swagger/OpenAPI docs, explicit CORS allowlisting, and tests. Run it separately with Uvicorn when starting a new service. It is intentionally not wired into the Next.js deployment and does not duplicate or proxy the live Neon commerce backend.


## Configurable power lens options and carousels

- Admin-managed power options live in the `power_options` content setting (`GET /api/admin/content` returns `settings.power_options`; save with `PUT /api/admin/content/settings/power_options`). Each option has an exact `value` (e.g. `-2.25`), a `label`, and a per-eye `surcharge`. The public home response also returns `powerOptions`.
- Products expose `availablePowerOptions` (value/label/surcharge). Product create/update accepts exact option values; legacy grouped ranges are still resolved to exact values.
- For products with power options, shoppers choose `lensChoice: "plain"` with both `leftPowerRange` and `rightPowerRange` null, or `lensChoice: "power"` with both exact option values. Plain lenses cost the base price; power lenses cost base price + the per-eye surcharges. The server compares `quotedUnitPrice` in cents. Existing clients may omit `lensChoice` when both valid power values are present; omitting it with both values absent is rejected for power-enabled products. Products without power choices continue to omit `lensChoice` and eye values. Order item `powerLeft` and `powerRight` are both `"plain"` for explicit plain choices, both exact diopter strings for power choices, and null for products without lens choices. Toric WhatsApp-only ordering is unchanged.
- Product comparison is local to each client: the website keeps up to three product slugs in the browser session and fetches their current details from `GET /api/products/{slug}`; the Flutter app uses its existing local comparison list. Product questions open WhatsApp with the product name, and sharing uses a public product URL (the app copies it). There is no server-side or cross-device comparison synchronization.
- Product presence: `POST /api/products/{slug}/viewers` with `{"viewerId":"<random UUID v4>"}` returns `{"data":{"count":1,"windowSeconds":120}}`. Generate a fresh random ID per product-view session, send when visible and every 60 seconds thereafter, and stop on backgrounding or leaving. The count is sessions with a heartbeat during the last two minutes, not necessarily distinct people or current live viewers; do not fabricate a fallback when unavailable. The database stores a hash, product ID and timestamp, not account details. Expired entries are removed in bounded batches by subsequent requests; configure a scheduled deletion for idle periods if strict retention is required. Apply migration `0024_product_viewer_presence.sql` before enabling. The existing per-process limiter is best-effort; configure distributed edge rate limiting for production, because automated clients can inflate counts and generate writes.
- Homepage hero slides are topped up with the shared default editorial images (`/isk-home/hero-editorial-*.jpg`) so at least five slides are served to web and mobile alike.
- Homepage carousels (web `components/ui/shared-carousel.tsx`, Flutter `apps/mobile/lib/isk_carousel.dart`) share five styles: coverflow, fade-slide, infinite-loop, smooth-slide, continuous. Autoplay advances right-to-left every 3 seconds, pauses on interaction, respects reduced motion, and loads at most 15 items per request. Catalog imagery uses contain-fit so images are never cropped.

## Free Cosmetic gift and full-width homepage carousels

- `GET /api/storefront/deals` returns active deal records with `id`, `name`, `type`, `categoryIds`, `buyQuantity`, `freeQuantity`, `discountPercent`, `priority` and category labels. `type` is `buy_get_free` or `bundle_discount`. Each qualifying bundle must contain at least one distinct product item from every selected category; the number of selected categories cannot exceed the bundle size, and a product unit can count in only one bundle. For Buy X Get Y Free, the lowest-priced Y items in each qualifying bundle are free. For a percentage bundle discount, every item in the complete bundle receives the configured percentage.
- Only the single offer that saves the most applies to an order. Equal savings are resolved by higher `priority`, then stable deal ID; offers do not stack. The website and Flutter app preview the same rules from `/api/storefront/deals`, and `POST /api/orders` independently recalculates with current product categories and prices. The discounted subtotal is used for delivery pricing, and discounted/free units are persisted on separate order-item lines.
- Admin configuration uses `PUT /api/admin/content/settings/deals` with a validated array of at most 30 offers. `GET /api/admin/content` returns the current setting. Staff can read it; admins and owners can change it.
- `GET /api/storefront/gift` returns the offer: `enabled`, `maxItems`, `minLensQuantity`, `badge`, `title`, `message`, `minimumSubtotalCents: 250000`, and eligible in-stock gift products. Admin config is the `free_gift` setting, managed in Admin > Free gift.
- `POST /api/orders` accepts `giftProductId` and `giftConfirmed`. A separate gift is valid only when no lens deal applies, the discounted merchandise subtotal is at least PKR 2,500, the order has at least `minLensQuantity` units whose product is not in the gift (Cosmetics) category, and `giftConfirmed` is `true`. The server revalidates and adds a zero-price "(Free gift)" line. Web and Flutter show gift choices only during checkout, and only after the current deal eligibility and gift requirements are verified.
- Homepage carousels are full width. Section order and styles are identical on web and mobile: categories coverflow, shades infinite-loop, brands (6th) fade-slide, lens types continuous; product tabs use distinct styles.

## Gift banner, checkout gift choice and Showcase section

- The gift strip appears while `GET /api/storefront/gift` reports an enabled offer with products; its copy says the PKR 2,500 minimum after discounts and no-deal combination rule, and it links to checkout.
- Gift choices are available only during checkout, not in the cart. Checkout offers a choice only when the discounted merchandise subtotal is at least PKR 2,500, the cart has no applied deal, and the configured non-gift lens quantity is met. The order API contract remains `giftProductId` + `giftConfirmed`; the server independently validates eligibility and stock.
- `GET /api/storefront/home` exposes `chrome.deliveryNotice`, `chrome.announcements`, and `chrome.trustNotice`. Web and mobile keep the configured delivery amount and the exact FDA notice in their continuous announcement ticker.
- The homepage has a new big-image `showcase` section (home configuration id `showcase`, defaults to order 1). Default order: hero, showcase, categories, shades, catalog, brands (6th), lens types, guidance, reviews, contact. It is driven by `GET /api/storefront/home` products (featured first) on web and mobile.

## Bulk product price and power options

- `PATCH /api/admin/products/bulk-price` `{ ids (1-100), mode: set|percent|amount, value, includeCompareAt }` updates product and variant prices.
- `PATCH /api/admin/products/bulk-power` `{ ids (1-100), mode: replace|add|remove, values[] }` edits available power values.
- Default power values are now 0.00 and -0.25 to -14.00 (0.25 steps); the admin power manager has an "Add missing values" button. Flutter has no bulk product list yet (web/REST only).

## Diameter editing

- The web and Flutter product editors offer diameter values 14, 14.2, 14.5 and 14.8 mm and display existing saved values. Product create/update APIs accept these values in `diameterMm`; legacy values from 0 to 12 in 0.1 increments remain supported. Other previously saved values may require correction before a product can be saved. Diameter is still a single product specification, not a customer-selectable list.

## Toric ordering

- Products whose lens type is named `Toric` appear automatically in the storefront Toric category, including `/api/product-categories` and the `category` filter of `/api/products`. This is a derived storefront category, not a change to the product's administrative category assignments.
- Public product records include `orderingPolicy: { mode: "whatsapp_advance_payment", notice, whatsappUrl }` for Toric products and `null` otherwise. Clients must direct shoppers to the provided WhatsApp URL, explain that confirmation and full advance payment are required, and not offer cash-on-delivery checkout. `POST /api/orders` rejects Toric items and gifts with HTTP 409, including from older clients.
- Prescription parameters and advance payment are confirmed with the store through WhatsApp. No payment is collected or verified by the API, and no Toric prescription ranges, combinations, prices or per-eye quantities are inferred from another retailer.

## Product carousel image previews

- Product records already provide `heroImageUrl` and ordered `assets`. On hover, the web product cards preview the first distinct managed gallery image after the primary image; pointer-enabled Flutter clients do the same. Touch clients continue to open the product gallery normally. A missing or failed alternate leaves the primary visible.
- Gallery order is not a classification of photo content: an administrator must place the intended full-person photograph first among images other than the primary using product media ordering. If the gallery has no such photograph, no accurate full-person preview is guaranteed.
