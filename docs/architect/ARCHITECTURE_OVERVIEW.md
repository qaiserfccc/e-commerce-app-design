# Architecture Overview — ISK Lenses

## Current production architecture

- Website and full-stack application: Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.
- Database and application backend: Neon Postgres through `pg` and Drizzle ORM. Next.js route handlers and server actions are the trusted backend.
- Native-client boundary: the versioned-compatible REST surface documented in `openapi.json`; Flutter/FlutterFlow clients must not connect directly to Postgres or call private Next.js Server Action URLs.
- Authentication: application-owned signed, HttpOnly shopper and admin cookies. Do not silently replace this with Neon Managed Better Auth; it would require an explicit account and session migration.
- Media: database-backed media objects in Neon, delivered through cacheable same-origin routes.
- Package manager: `pnpm`.
- Deployment status: Vercel + Neon is the production platform. The verified Vercel project is `e-commerce-app-design` in `pro-team-trial-bc9638f2` (project ID `prj_H4gRTj6bFfmWXCoprIyKyfGcU3bz`); it owns `isklenses.com`, and `www.isklenses.com` redirects to the apex. Its Production database URL connects to the populated Neon `neondb` catalog (405 active products; 401 matched active products with SEO payloads and correct canonicals). `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` is configured in Vercel Production. The crawler routes are in the reviewed change and require its production deployment before they become live. No DNS records were changed; `isklenses.online` remains on Hostinger and currently returns HTTP 500.
- Current client refresh: SWR polling/revalidation remains the fallback. A Neon Realtime sealed-query endpoint and TanStack DB catalog-version collection are implemented for the public catalog. Production Realtime credentials are not configured; keep the existing polling fallback.
- AI assistant: the chatbot can invoke a stateless, server-side Mastra agent through Vercel AI Gateway when `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is configured. Each turn queries the current public FAQ/catalog data from the same Neon database first. Without the key, the existing deterministic assistant remains available. The agent has no tools, database access, persistent memory, or business-write permissions. ISK does not store conversation history; third-party processing and retention policies may apply.

## Cross-platform target architecture

The platform request is to extend the existing product rather than replace working systems with parallel stacks:

1. **Web:** retain Next.js as the website, backend-for-frontend, and API owner. Adopt TanStack DB/Neon Realtime only for screens that need live, optimistic collections; Neon’s TanStack Start example is an alternative full-stack framework, not an instruction to run TanStack Start beside Next.js or to migrate the website wholesale.
2. **Android and iOS:** use Flutter, consistent with the earlier mobile-client direction. Consume the same documented HTTPS API and cookie-based shopper sessions. Keep commerce validation, pricing, stock reservation, permissions, and persistence on the server.
3. **Live synchronization:** the web catalog uses a server-sealed, aggregate-only live query and TanStack DB to invalidate its existing API-backed SWR catalog cache. The endpoint exposes only active-catalog count/version, not customer or administrative data. Realtime credentials are not verified in the current production environment; SWR polling remains the fallback. Never ship `DATABASE_URL` or `NEON_REALTIME_SECRET` to a client. Flutter uses the REST API and explicit refresh; do not connect mobile apps directly to Postgres.
4. **Mastra:** the current chatbot agent runs inside the Node.js 22.18+ Next.js-compatible runtime and receives only the current public FAQ/catalog snapshot. It has no persistent memory, tools, or business-write path. Future background agents must be separate server-side workers triggered by committed, durable application events, with explicit retention, authorization, and approval policies.
5. **TanStack and API parity:** TanStack DB is an optional browser-side reactive collection layer, not a second source of truth. Preserve REST/OpenAPI as the mobile contract and update it whenever a web behavior changes.

## Deployment status

- Next.js is the only deployment framework. The verified `e-commerce-app-design` Vercel Production project uses the populated Neon `neondb` connection; do not use the unrelated `isk-lenses-website-migration` Vercel project.
- `isklenses.com` is attached to the verified Vercel project and `www.isklenses.com` redirects to the apex. No DNS changes were made. `isklenses.online` remains on Hostinger and currently returns HTTP 500.
- Cloudflare D1 (`isk-lenses-storefront`) and its Hyperdrive config were deleted after confirming that application tables contained no catalog, customer, order, secret, or media data. No Pages project or R2 bucket was present. DNS zones were not changed.

## Readiness and external prerequisites

The platform foundations are implemented; production Realtime is active, while AI chatbot generation and native store distribution have separate prerequisites:

- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in server-only runtime secrets for Mastra responses; Node.js 22.18+ is required by the project runtime. The deterministic chatbot fallback works without this key.
- A reviewed agent use case, access policy, retention policy, and approval boundary for any agent-authored business-data changes.
- Android application ID, Apple bundle ID, signing, store accounts, and a deployment/release process before publishing mobile binaries.
- Any database migration and production environment changes through the repository’s documented review/deployment process.

Do not treat an existing `NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL` as proof that Neon Realtime is enabled. Do not assume Neon Managed Better Auth is configured. Current user accounts remain under the existing application-owned session system.

## Code layout

- Database migrations: `db/migrations/`, mirrored in `lib/db/schema.ts`.
- Server actions: `app/actions/`.
- REST API route handlers: `app/api/`.
- Client refresh hooks: `lib/hooks/`.
- Native/mobile integration contract: `openapi.json` and `docs/API_MOBILE_INTEGRATION.md`.
- Flutter shopper app: `apps/mobile/`; uses the API contract for catalog, power selection, COD checkout, chatbot, shopper sessions, and order summaries.
- Architecture decisions and operational status: this file and `docs/NEXT_AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

## Scripts

- `scripts/validate-build.mjs` — build validation.
- `scripts/validate-schema.mjs` — schema validation (requires `DATABASE_URL`).
- `scripts/validate-openapi.mjs` — OpenAPI paths and references validation.
- `scripts/rehost-source-product-images.mjs` — restores product photos into the database-backed media library.
- `scripts/restore-content-images.mjs` — restores seeded storefront images into the database-backed media library.

## Security notes

- Admin sessions require `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`; shopper sessions use the configured shopper signing secret.
- Keep database credentials, Realtime signing secrets, model-provider credentials, and session keys server-side; never commit them.
- Do not let a Realtime subscription replace authorization checks in API handlers or database mutations.
