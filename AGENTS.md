# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Repository-wide implementation rules

- **API/mobile parity is mandatory.** Whenever a storefront or admin behavior, data field, validation rule, filter, sorting rule, visibility rule, or workflow changes, update the corresponding public or authenticated API in the same change so mobile clients (including Flutter/FlutterFlow) can observe and perform the same behavior. Keep the API discovery document, OpenAPI contract, and `docs/API_MOBILE_INTEGRATION.md` aligned whenever endpoint behavior or schemas change. Do not silently leave a web-only behavior: if parity is impossible or intentionally out of scope, explain that explicitly in the change summary and integration documentation.
- **Check all relevant surfaces before finishing.** Trace the changed behavior through the UI, shared data/domain logic, route handlers, response schemas, and API documentation. Add or update tests/contract validation for parity where the repository has suitable coverage.
- **Persist durable decisions.** Keep these rules and important operational decisions in `docs/architect/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `docs/NEXT_AGENT_HANDOFF.md` so future agents receive them even when conversation history is unavailable.
